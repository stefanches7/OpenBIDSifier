    - "This is a macaque brain MRI database characterizing the normal postnatal macaque brain development. This longitudinal primate database was acquired from a cohort of healthy macaque monkeys ranging from a few week olds up to 3-year-old adolescents.

    - "Each scan consists of structural (both T1 and T2) and diffusion MRI. T1 and T2 are provided as NRRD format in the original scanner space as well as in a common atlas space where they are rigidly aligned. Diffusion MRI is provided as raw diffusion weighted images. In addition, pre-processing was performed including motion and eddy current distortion correction on the diffusion weighted MR and tensors were calculated with diffusion property maps (FA, MD, Baseline and iDWI)."
